        <h5>Internship Week 4</h5>
<div class= "date"><span>16 July 2017</span></div>
<p>This was a very busy and exciting week! On Monday, we had an Intern Lunch at Cafe O Lei and worked on some models in Autocad Civil 3d. On Tuesday, in addition to working on models, we visited a construction site in Makena. We also prepared for our trip to Lanai on Friday. On Thursday, we continued preparing for our trip. On Friday, we started our adventure to Lanai at 5:15 AM. We drove to Lahaina from Kihei and caught the 6:45 AM ferry to Lanai. From there, we did our static survey on the Lanai site using GPS units (similar to what we did a couple weeks ago), and while we were waiting for the data to be collected we went to grab lunch in Lanai City. Finally, we caught the 2:00 ferry back to Lahaina, drove from Lahaina back to Kihei, and I waited at the office for my dad to pick me up.
</p><p>I had already discussed our Lanai trip before, so in this blog post I would like to talk more about the intern lunch. Goodfellow has their own internship program, mostly for college aged students. Jett, Ethan, and I are all high school interns; Jett and I specifically are the STEMworks interns. It was an awesome experience to get to know the other interns and to hear their stories. We discussed what got us interested in STEM, what we are majoring in (or hoping to major in ) and the various construction projects we’ve been involved in as part of our internships. I also got to know all of the mentors better and hear their stories about how they ended up at Goodfellow. What really struck me was how they all said that Goodfellow was their family; many of them had been working for Goodfellow for over ten years. We all filled up a giant table at Cafe O Lei, and yet we were still sitting shoulder to shoulder.

        <h5>Internship Week 3</h5>
<div class= "date"><span>9 July 2017</span></div>
<p>This week was fairly short because I had a half day on Monday and Tuesday was the Fourth of July.As usual, I didn't go to work on Wednesday. On Monday, I mostly worked in Autocad Civil 3D, elevating ramps and getting to know the software better. On Thursday, my mentor, fellow interns, and I all went to Kaanapali to survey one of the construction sites using GPS units. When we got back to the office, we started looking at some of the data we collected, even though it couldn't be post processed until the next morning. Finally, on Friday, I came to work a little later and missed when everyone visited Lahaina (I emailed my mentor). So, I worked on elevating ramps for that part of the morning. Then, when everyone got back, we worked more in Autocad Civil 3D, went to a pizza party at the main office, had an engineering department meeting, and I helped set up one of the company computers.
</p><p>One of the highlights of this week was getting to attend the biweekly Engineering Services Meeting. All of the people within the fairly small Engineering Services department met to discuss the progress of the projects they’re designing models for. It was fascinating to hear about all of the various construction projects happening on Maui, as well as the struggles the contractors were facing. For example, at one project they accidentally placed some object like a parking meter or an electrical box (I can’t remember anymore)  too far towards the middle of the sidewalk. The meeting lasted a lot longer than I thought it would; I had been in the meeting for at least two hours and I had to leave after that because my dad was there to pick me up.

  <h5>Internship Week 2</h5>
<div class= "date"><span>2 July 2017</span></div>
<p>I couldn't come in during Tuesday and Wednesday due to finals week, and I had my Calculus final in the morning on Thursday. This week, my fellow interns and I made more progress with Autocad Civil 3d, learned how to use laser equipment to determine distance and elevation, and learned some math using midordinates to solve real world problems. We were given a midordinate 'homework problem' where we had to find the distance on the circumference of the earth that one could set up gps units for surveying without running into issues with the curvature of the earth. Our error had to be less that 0.1 feet.
</p><p>I have been getting better at using Autocad Civil 3d. We were provided with Lynda.com as a resource for our internship program and I have been utilizing it to better understand the software. Lynda.com is basically a resource that provides tutorials and courses in various skills; it’s very popular for learning new softwares. The ramps still frustrate me, as none of the lines seem to add up well. With some of the ramps I was building, the distance between the ‘real’ lines and the ones I drew were well over our error threshold, which I believe is 0.1 ft.

          <h5>Internship Week 1</h5>
          <div class= "date"><span>25 June 2017</span></div>
          <p>I didn't clock in very many hours this week due to scheduling constraints with my summer college class (my class met on Tuesday and Thursday, and I had the webinar on Wednesday). My class ends next week and I hope to make up the hours I've lost due to it. On the days I was at work this week, we visited a construction site, got started with Autocad Civil 3d, went to a blessing ceremony for a project in Wailea, and learned a lot from our mentor about surveying and civil engineering.
          </p><p>After visiting a construction site the first day, I had to take the next two days off for school. When I showed up at the office on Wednesday, everyone had already gotten started with Autocad Civil 3d and I had some catching up to do. I had to wait a couple hours for Civil 3d to download and install on my computer. From there, my mentor showed me and my fellow mentors the basics of how to start outlining ramps in Civil 3d. There’s definitely a learning curve to it, as the linework I was tracing was somewhat sloppy to begin with. I found that one has to exercise a certain level of decision making when it comes to arcs that don’t fit perfectly to the predetermined curves.
          </p><p>Mr. Clarke taught us a lot about surveying this week, from showing us the GPS systems that surveyors use to explaining a little bit of the math to us. He showed us a neat calculator that would help us a lot as future engineers and talked about some of his experiences as both a civil engineer and a surveyor. We were introduced to lot of people in the engineering services team as well as other people from different teams that worked in the same office.
          </p><p>Finally, we wrapped up the week with a blessing ceremony for a project in Wailea. We got to experience the blessing itself and eat lots of amazing food. They had Kalua pork, poi, rice, and many other local favorites that were cooked at home. The pig itself had been buried and cooked by employees at Goodfellow, I believe at the construction site itself. While we were eating after the ceremony, I got a chance to talk to my mentor Todd and my fellow interns more. Ethan, one of the interns, gave Jett (other intern) and I a ride to the ceremony as our mentor Kevin (Mr. Clarke) was unable to attend. We definitely got to know each other better when we were talking in the car and listening to music. Within the first week, I already feel that we will be good friends and coworkers.

        <div>  <h5>Internship Day 0 </h5>
          <div class="date"><span>20 June 2017</span></div>
          <p>Today, I officially began my internship with Goodfellow Bros.</p>

<p>I showed up at the office a little before 8:00 AM and met my mentor, Mr. Clarke. From there, my fellow interns and I all went to orientation, where we learned a little about the company's history and a lot about field safety. Orientation was at least two or three hours, since we watched a couple 30 minute safety videos, went through a slideshow, had a discussion around the table, and had some slight technical difficulties.
</p><p>
From there, the other high school interns and I, three of us total, went back to our mentor's office and learned more about the type of engineering projects he works on. Mr. Clarke explained what some of the symbols and terminology meant. He's a civil engineer that works on models and other things for the company, but he used to be a surveyor for a long time so he also taught us quite a bit about how surveying works. We got to see some of the extremely accurate GPS units and got a quick lesson on two different types of surveying using GPS. He also told us that, in the past, surveyors used to mainly rely on lasers rather than GPS. Lasers are still used to some extent today, but GPS trilateration can be very accurate.
</p><p>
Mr. Clarke  also brought out the plans for several projects on the island and had us look through them to get a feel for what we'll be working on during our internship. We didn't have the login information for the computers we will be using at the office, so we weren't able to try the CAD software yet. However, getting the chance to look through the plans and learning from Mr. Clarke about what some of the symbols meant will probably help us once we are all set up with our computers.
</p><p>
After lunch, Mr. Clarke had to deliver some equipment to one of the construction sites and he let all of us interns come along. We were all issued hard hats, reflective vests, protective glasses, and gloves. We had a tour of the construction site near the Kahului Airport. It was very fascinating and cool to watch all of the workers digging trenches and operating massive machines. The one insight that struck me the most was how all of the workers acted like a family. They would laugh, talk with each other about meeting up over the weekend, and shaka at each other while driving by in the construction vehicles. They were also very knowledgable and answered all my questions about their work, projects, and equipment.
</p><p>
Overall, it was an awesome first day and I'm super excited for the rest of my internship. I'm surrounded by so many people that are very knowledgable about engineering and construction and I'm very eager to learn a lot from them about their work.
