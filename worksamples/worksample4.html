   <div class="clicktoview">ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN OCT. 2015</div>
  <p>The Biology Cell Project challenged my information skills because I had to complete a lot of research and take a lot of notes. I researched all of the different cell organelles as well as some new inventions or ideas for my project. I compiled everything into a realistic 3D model of a cell-town of the future.I had to take notes from the resources we were given and from the resources that I found. I also used a lot of my notes from Biology class.
</p><p>
I am very proud of my cell model, mostly because I really enjoyed building it. I am also proud because I worked on the model for multiple days and for many hours. I surprisingly kept myself organized and outlined pretty much every aspect of the project. One of the reasons that I loved this project was that it combined my love of science with engineering and technology (my other two loves). I especially enjoyed working on the model because I got to be creative and I enjoyed dreaming up the City Of The Future. I loved to fill my city of the future with new ideas that are currently being developed and making the whole city an analogy for a cell.
</p><p>
I developed on my information skills by finding new resources that were helpful for this Biology project and may be helpful for future Biology projects. I also found some efficient, engaging, and visually appealing ways to take notes. Finally, I learned how to present very technical information in an interesting, visually appealing way.
</p><p>
The most difficult part of this assignment was probably picking and choosing the right information. Some of the websites I visited had contradicting ‘facts’ and not all of the resources I came across were reliable. Finishing and posting the assignment on time was also super difficult because I spent a little too long designing the city. I also spent a lot of precious time building the models.
</p><p>
If I could start over, I probably wouldn’t have spent so long drawing out the models and I would have started building the models sooner. I would have used better video editing software for better quality videos. I should have tried using Blender to animate the city however I knew that it would take too long. I would have also posted it to my personal youtube channel rather than my school account.
</p><p>
In the past, I learned about 3D modeling and I have built plenty of 3D models in Google Sketchup. I also learned about the parts of a cell and their functions at multiple points in my academic career. However, in Ms. Wilson’s class, I learned about the parts of the cell in the most detail. I can apply this experience and knowledge to future learning. I know now to make better quality videos for future projects. I also found out about Creative Commons electronic music that I can use in future assignments. Finally, this project taught me ways to think outside of the box for future assignments.
