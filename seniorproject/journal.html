       <div class="date"><span>7 Dec 2017</span></div>
       <p>Driving Question: How can I teach coding to students at Kihei Charter in an interesting and interactive way?</p>
<p>Timeline:</p>
<p>Week of Tuesday 12/5-Finished basic curriculum outlines for all pathways</p>
<p>Week of Tuesday 12/12-Will have gotten through at least STEP 3 of the Creating a Web App from Scratch guide with my own web app. Basically, all the databases should be set up by now. </p>
<p>Week of Tuesday 12/19-Will have gotten through at least STEP 6 of the Creating a Web App from Scratch guide with my own web app. Basically, AJAX Interactivity added to webapp.</p>
<p>Week of Tuesday 12/26-Will have gotten through the entire Creating a Web App from Scratch guide. Should have a basic (non precious) prototype of the web app that I can beautify, add curriculum + media to, and modify.</p>
<p> I would like to have a meeting with Mrs. Alexander about my project progression sometime during the week of December 5th, as I have important things to update her on (such as the tentative dates for the class I’m teaching). I would hope to meet with her on December 5th during class, however before class or on December 7th would definitely also be doable.</p>

          Kris Murali (kmurali@kiheicharter.org) is the Engineering teacher at KCS. I am taking over his class for some time during quarter three and we are hopefully meeting today (as previously discussed last week) to go over some of the specifics for the schedule and which classes of students I will be teaching. This information is vital for the success of my project.

    <h5>Blog 4: Status Update</h5>
     <div class="date"><span>14 Nov 2017</span></div>
    Current status of project:<br>
<ul>
<li>Got CodeKCS domain name <a href="http://codekcs.me/">http://codekcs.me/</a>. Whipped up a dummy page so that people have something to look at if they go to the site. Github repository exists and is configured to publish my code to the webpage.</li>
<li>Created the design skeleton of the online portion in Sketch</li>
<li>Completed SQL course on Codecademy so that I understand how to create the database</li>
<li>Finished Java and Sass courses on Codecademy, to brush up on skills I want to teach in the course. Started working on some of their project based courses (Responsive Design, Deploying Websites) to see if I should have CodeKCS students work on them as assignments.</li>
<li>Finished curriculum outline/details for Week One of CodeKCS. Finalized list of Pathways and their descriptions. Still finalizing which projects I want each pathway to work on.</li>
<li>Put together general ideas for grading system, syllabus layout, and the overall structure of how I want to teach the class. Also put together a general idea of how the beta testing will work. I hope to have either virtual or physical office hours so that the beta testers will still have support.</li>
<li>Still trying to figure out if we have enough time for a couple guest speakers via Google Hangouts. Will have to reach out to the guest speakers, however they are all already part of my network and I know that they would all be psyched to talk to KCS kids about code! :) </li>
<li>Put together a general timeline for building & putting together the web app.</li>
</ul>

    <h5>Blog 3: Research (Information Skills)</h5>
     <div class="date"><span>14 Nov 2017</span></div>
     <img src="images/research.jpg" width="50%" color="white" border="2px">
<p>Thus far in my research, I learned a lot about the negative effects of coding stereotypes on students. One of the most pressing examples that I hadn’t considered right now was the effect of the male programmer stereotype on young girls who are interested in programming. One study showed that both male and female children associated males with programming and said that boys are naturally better at programming, despite that not necessarily being the case in their own classroom. This study, as well as others, illustrated that stereotypes about programming can start as young as first grade. Apart from gender stereotypes, many young people have picked up stereotypes about computer programmers being antisocial and bad communicators, which adds to the established negative feelings many students already have towards code. Finally, in my research, I looked into computational learning and how to measure that in students. Basically, this means measuring how well students have picked up the ‘programming mentality’. One of the best ways to measure this is by taking a look at the variation of data structures used by students when they code (either using Scratch or a different language). More variation and creativity with code shows true understanding, while seeing the same things over again either indicate copy/pasting or a not quite deep understanding. Such things, of course, aren’t black and white. When it comes to grading code, I have decided that I’m better off grading qualitatively, factoring in what I know about the student, rather than just trying to crunch quantitative data.</p>

<p>All of these sources are related to programming education and what it’s like to be a programmer in the real world. I would say that they’re all fairly reliable because every single one of them comes from a source that is well known for credibility. If there was an error or a bias, the authors would be more likely to add a correction. The least reliable of them is perhaps the Medium article, however I was referring to it more as a blog/real life experience article rather than a source for hard data.</p>

   <h5>Blog 1: Driving Question & Measurable Goal</h5>
    <div class="date"><span>19 Oct 2017</span></div>
    <p><b>Driving Question:</b> How can I teach coding to students at Kihei Charter in an interesting and interactive way?
</p>
Goals:
<ul>
  <li>Have every student complete a final coding project based on their passions that shows what they learned in the class. </li>
  <li>Give the students a survey about how useful the class was, if they feel that they've grown as a programmer, if it changed their perspectives about coding, etc. Get positive feedback on all those areas by at least 70% of the class.</li>
  <li>Based on computational learning tests, students will show at least a 50% improvement in computational learning/problem solving by the end of the course. </li>
</ul>
